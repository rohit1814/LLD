# âœ… Key points:
# threading.Lock in Python replaces C++ std::mutex.
# __new__ is overridden (not __init__) since it controls object creation.
# The double check ensures the constructor is called only once, even with multiple threads.

    _instance = None
    _lock = threading.Lock()  # class-level lock for thread safety

                # Second check (inside lock)
                if cls._instance is None:
                    cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
